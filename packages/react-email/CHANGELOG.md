- f9483ec: Deprecated `renderAsync` and made `render` itself always async

  ## Why

  Three reasons:

  1. Better support of NextJS's latest versions
  2. Being ready for future React API deprecations
  3. Support for Suspense which allows for using async inside components

  See https://github.com/resend/react-email/discussions/1144 for more info.

  ## How to upgrade

  If you are using the old `render`, you will need to now treat the Promise
  that comes out of it, as it is now async. If you are using `renderAsync`,
  you can replace it with `render` and things should work the same.
