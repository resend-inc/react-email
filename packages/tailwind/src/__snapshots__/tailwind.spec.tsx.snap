"You are trying to use the following Tailwind classes that have media queries: sm:bg-red-500.
For the media queries to work properly on rendering, they need to be added into a <style> tag inside of a <head> tag,
the Tailwind component tried finding a <head> element but just wasn't able to find it.

Make sure that you have either a <head> element at some point inside of the <Tailwind> component at any depth.

If you do already have a <head> element at some depth, please file a bug https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=1.bug_report.yml."
