</CodeGroup>

## Getting started

Add the component around your email body content.

```jsx
import { Tailwind, Button } from "@react-email/components";

const Email = () => {
  return (
    <Tailwind
      config={{
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              brand: "#007291",
            },
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      <Button
        href="https://example.com"
        className="bg-brand px-3 py-2 font-medium leading-4 text-white"
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </Tailwind>
  );
};
```

## Props

<ResponseField name="config" type="object">
  Customize the default theme for your project with the available properties in
  [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).
</ResponseField>

<Info>
    Most email clients are style-limited and some styles may not work.

    One example of this is how Tailwind will uses `rem` as it's main unit for better accessbility. 
    This is not going to be supported by [some email clients](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-unit-rem/)
    and we recommend that you define a Tailwind config to override these if you care
    about the support for those email clients. We will not do this ourselves, though.

## Known limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Support up to Tailwind v3.3.2">
    Due to an internal technical limitation, we are still running on Tailwind `3.3.2`. This is 
because Tailwind migrated into using async APIs internally after [`3.3.3`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.3.3)
and the only way we can migrate is by using Suspense on the Tailwind component which would
force everyone into using only `renderAsync`.

You can track our progress on [this issue](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/1372).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No support for prose from @tailwindcss/typography">
    We do not yet support `prose`, and beyond that, we don't yet support classes that might
be resolved into selectors that are relatively complex. That is, selectors with more
than a class lookup.

This is because we optimistically look into the selectors for class names
and look them up later on the elements, and since `prose` by using more complicated selectors cannot be inlined,
this means `prose` does not work. This might also mean some other utilities might not work either.

The only exception for this inlining of styles is with media queries, as they are not inlinable. We do not
do the same for `hover:` styles though, but since [their support is not best](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-pseudo-class-hover/), you probably won't need it.

In the future, we will be inlining all the styles we can by actually matching the 
selectors *against the elements* themselves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limitations when trying to manipulate classes">
    Currently, the component works, at a high level, going through the following steps:

1. Do a very surface-level rendering on the children to have something resembling the HTML
2. Run `tailwind` as a `postcss` plugin in the new fake rendered email template to generate a CSS stylesheet with all the styles of the template
3. Generate a map of all the class names pointing to their respective styles
4. Run recursively through all elements, and their children, by looking up class by class to add the appropriate styles to it while removing the classes

The biggest cause of limitation here is going to be `1.`. Since that fake rendering process does not render
the components, that means that, if a class name doesn't appear in the resulting HTML, it won't have
its style either, so the class isn't removed. Here's an example:

```jsx
const Component = ({ className, style }) => {
  console.log(className, style);
  return <div className={`bg-red-500`} style={style} />;
};

export default function Email() {
  return <Tailwind>
    <Component className="bg-blue-400" />
  </Tailwind>;
};
```

The prop for `className` will come in as `bg-blue-400` which would seem like you can manipulate the className,
but once you add it somewhere to the resulting HTML, like:

```jsx
const Component = ({ className, style }) => {
  console.log(className, style);
  return <div className={`bg-red-500 ${className}`} style={style} />;
};

export default function Email() {
  return <Tailwind>
    <Component className="bg-blue-400" />
  </Tailwind>;
};
```

The email will render with a red background and a `class="undefined"` attribute as the class will have
been removed. This means that manipulations are very unstable at the current version. 

In a future version, the behavior is going to be of resolving the styles regardless of them appearing
in the HTML, and along with the `className` not being removed for React elements that are components,
so that you are able to manipulate both of them at the same time.

On small email templates this is most likely not going to be an issue, though.
