    </Tailwind>
  );
};
```

## Know limitations

### Not yet Tailwind v3.4

Due to an internal technical limitation, we are still running on Tailwind `3.3.2`. This is 
because Tailwind migrated into using async APIs internally after [`3.3.3`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.3.3)
and the only way we can migrate is by using Suspense on the Tailwind component which would
force everyone into using only `renderAsync`.

You can track our progress on this on [this issue](https://github.com/resend/react-email/issues/1372)
or by checking this page once in a while.

### No supoprt for `prose` from `@tailwindcss/typography`

We do not yet support `prose`, and beyond that, we don't yet support classes that might
be resolved into selectors that are relatively complex. That is, selectors with more
than a class lookup.

This is because we optimistically look into the selectors for class names
and look them up later on the elements, and since `prose` by using more complicated selectors cannot be inlined,
this means `prose` does not work. This might also mean some other utilities might not work either.

The only exception for this inlining of styles is with media queries, as they are not inlinable. We do not
do the same for `hover:Â´ styles though, but since [their support is not best](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-pseudo-class-hover/), you probably won't need it.

In the future, we will be inlining all the styles we can by actually matching the 
selectors *against the elements* themselves.

## Props

<ResponseField name="config" type="object">
  Customize the default theme for your project with the available properties in
  [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).
</ResponseField>

<Info>
    Most email clients are style-limited and some styles may not work.

    One example of this is how Tailwind will uses `rem` as it's main unit for better accessbility. 
    This is not going to be supported by [some email clients](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-unit-rem/)
    and we recommend that you define a Tailwind config to override these if you care
    about the support for those email clients. We will not do this ourselves, though.
