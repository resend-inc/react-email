## 1. Install dependencies

Install package from your command line.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install @react-email/eslint-plugin -E -D
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @react-email/eslint-plugin -E -D
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @react-email/eslint-plugin -E -D

```

## 2. Creating a `.eslintrc.json` for your emails folder

Since the plugin can't detect properly what React component is an email
or if weather it is inside the emails folder, you will need to create a new config file
inside of your `emails` directory. Here's an example using our recommended configurations:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@react-email"],
  "extends": ["plugin:@react-email/recommended", "PATH_TO_YOUR_DEFAULT_ESLINT_CONFIG"]
}
```

From here you can activate or deactivate rules as you prefer. We have a rule for each
email client + platform combination for both unsupported and partially supported features,
by default, the major email clients + all their platforms will error for unsupported properties
and warn for partially supported properties.

These default settings get making the email templates into a really good flow since 
you now get in-the-editor errors that point into what issues your email template has.
